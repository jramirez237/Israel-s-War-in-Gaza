   <p id="first-par">The Israeli military has <b>desecrated at least 16 cemeteries</b> in its ground offensive in Gaza, a CNN investigation has found, leaving gravestones ruined, soil upturned and, in some cases, bodies unearthed. In Khan Younis, southern Gaza, where <i>fighting escalated</i> in recent days, Israeli forces destroyed a cemetery, removing bodies in what the Israel Defense Forces told CNN was part of a search for the remains of hostages seized by Hamas during the October 7, 2023, terror attacks.CNN has reviewed satellite imagery and social media footage showing the <i>destruction of cemeteries</i> — and witnessed it firsthand while traveling with the IDF in a convoy. Together, the evidence reveals a systemic practice.The intentional destruction of religious sites, such as cemeteries, violates international law, except under narrow circumstances relating to that site becoming a military objective, and legal experts told CNN that Israel’s acts could amount to war crimes. A spokesperson for the IDF could not account for the destruction of the 16 cemeteries CNN provided coordinates for, but said the military sometimes has “no other choice” but to target cemeteries it claimed Hamas uses for military purposes.</p>




    <p id="second-par">The <b>Palestine Red Crescent Society</b> said it received a shipment Sunday from the Egyptian Red Crescent, consisting of a total of <i>80 trucks</i> that arrived at the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza.The trucks carried essential <b>humanitarian aid, including food, water, relief assistance and medical supplies</b>. Additionally, the Palestinian aid organization said 105 more humanitarian aid trucks entered through the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing on the same day.</p>

    <li >Netanyahu rejects any deal with Hamas for the release of captives that would end the war, despite calls from Israeli politicians.</li>
    <li >Gaza’s Health Ministry says 178 Palestinians were killed and 293 injured in 24 hours, with attacks nearing Khan Younis’s vital Nasser Hospital.</li>
    <li >Israeli government approves deal for frozen tax funds for the occupied West Bank and Gaza to be held in Norway, instead of being transferred to the Palestinian Authority. The latter rejects any conditions placed on its receipt of the tax revenue.
    </li>
    <li >At least 25,105 people have been killed and 62,681 wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7. The death toll in Israel from the October 7 Hamas attack stands at 1,139.
